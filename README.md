# Flask URL shortener

A damn easy to use URL shortener made using Python and Flask microframework

## Installation and Usage

This project uses Pipenv for the dependency management. Here's how to install it.

```sh
pipenv sync -d
```

### Usage

You can use the shortener API by its API or Web UI too.

Here's how to get started with running the App

```sh
pipenv run start
```

This should boot up the app on [127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) by default. Open it to access
The Web UI for shortening URLs, or The API to shorten URLs located at `/api/shorten`. You can also grab info
about shortened URL from [127.0.0.1:5000/info](http://127.0.0.1:5000/info) too! It has an endpoint linked 
(`/api/shorten`) for grabbing the info. More information below. 

### Configuration

You can change the `HOST`, `PORT` and `DEBUG` mode, By changing the settings in `config.py` inside the `app/`
folder.

### Usage guide

Here's how to use the API.

Make a `GET` request to `/api/shorten?redirect_url=<your-url>`, Replace `<your-url>` with the URL
you want to shorten. Once done properly, It should return a JSON like the following:

```json
{
    "shortened_url": "<shortened-url>"
}
```

Where `<shortened-url>` will be the URL shortened by the APP.

There is also an info endpoint, that shows the number of visits as of now only.

Make a `GET` Request to `/api/info?code=<shortened_url_code>`, Replace the `<shortened_url_code>`
with your code, and once done, it should return a JSON response like following:

```json
{
  "visits": "<visits>",
  "date_created": "<date_created>",
  "redirects_to": "<URL>"
}
```

Note, Visits is an integer here and `date_created` is a date.

## How it works?

Here are the steps we do after the request for shortening an URL:

- Check if the URL starts with `http://` or `https://`, if it doesn't, Add `http://` to the start.
  
- Next, Make a DB object for the link, and pass in the `redirect_url`, and wait for an ID and short URL
  to be assigned.
  
- The DB does the following steps for a unique URL:
  - Generates a Random string, consisting of Alphabets and Digits, and Base62 encodes the ID and adds them both
  - Adds and updates it in the Database
  
- Once the URL is generated, I send the JSON Response like this:
```json
{
    "short_url": "<shortened-url>"
}
```
- If you're using the API it ends here, But for the Web UI, We take user input, fetch the API using the
  internal `fetch` function in JavaScript, and display it in the Fields using Powerful JQuery.

- Finally, on visiting the shortened link, We redirect to the URL to which redirection is specified.
